# Face_recognition
Mini project on IP..
Comparing unknown face with the current faces in database n recognising the unknown one :) 
Currently using IP for the same..
Algorithms used are PCA as of now..
Principal Compenent Analysis .. an algo that is used for dimensional redundancy..
It uses image based approach.
Other algo used are LDA etc..
Other approach can be geometric approach which means dealing with the geometric features of the face ,say,calculating the disatnce between our eyes or width of iur nose etc..
